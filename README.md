A web app modeled after the game Boggle.

The goal is to make words using the letters shown. A valid word is any combination of letters that go left, right, up, down, and diagonally from each other.

This app uses Flask to serve the main files and uses a boggle.py file to handle the logic of creating the game board and validating user guesses.

The index.js file handles AJAX calls to the users and handles user requests.
